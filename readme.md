# Day 9 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

Oh, the ninth day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge). Hangman.

It was a lovely project, I loved that it was so easy to work with [Wordnik's API](http://developer.wordnik.com). I think the most time consuming task was the drawing of Stick Man. And he just dies or never becomes a fully drawn character...

Woo-hoo, you can find the React version here: [React Hangman](https://github.com/zsoltime/react-hangman) 

## User Stories

- [x] I can start the game and see the number of characters of the secret word
- [x] I can click on a letter and if it's in the word, i can see its position, if not one more part of the graphic is drawn.
- [x] If I make more than 10 mistakes, the game ends.

## Next Steps

I definitely will add the "Hint" functionality. It's quite easy to get rhyming words and synonyms with other API calls.
